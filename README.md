## How to use it

- First, make sure user-script web browser extension is installed.
Greasemonkey and Tampermonkey are good trusted choices supported in majority of the browsers.

- Second, install current version of the [`revwherigo` script](https://github.com/avogadogc/revwherigo/raw/master/revwherigo.user.js).

- Finally, click the button on a reverse whereigo geocache to have the final coordinates updated.

- In case the codes cannot be extracted from the text of the listing, put them in the user note. The script will extract them from there.
